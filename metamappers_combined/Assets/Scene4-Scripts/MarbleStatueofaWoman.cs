The back of the drapery is not carefully finished as it would not have been visible. The production of such elaborate grave monuments with large-scale statues came to an end in Attica in 317 or 307 B.C. when Demetrios of Phaleron, the governor of Athens, issued a law prohibiting ostentatious display by wealthy families.";

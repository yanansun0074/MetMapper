        description = "In medieval weaponry, the breastplate is the front portion of plate armour covering the torso. It has been a military mainstay since ancient times and was usually made of leather, bronze or iron in antiquity. By around 1000 AD, solid plates had fallen out of use in Europe and knights of the period were wearing mail in the form of a hauberk over a padded tunic.[1] Plates protecting the torso reappeared in the 1220s as plates directly attached to a knightly garment known as the surcoat.[2][1] Around 1250 this developed into the coat of plates which continued to be in use for about a century.[3][1] True breastplates reappear in Europe in 1340 first composed of wrought iron and later of steel. These early breastplates were made of several plates and only covered the upper torso with the lower torso not being protected by plate until the development of the fauld around 1370.";

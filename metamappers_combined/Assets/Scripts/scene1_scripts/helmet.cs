        description = "Barbute helmets did not have visors, although the needs of the warrior are what dictate the evolution of the helm. This Epic Dark Visored Barbuta Helmet is as protective as a typical barbute and then-some, thanks to the visor. The barbute, or barbuta, was originally designed in medieval Italy, although because of how effective and useful the helmet was, it spread to other regions as well. This helmet alters the typical design of a barbute by including a protective visor. The visor is distinctive in design, possessing two rectangular eyelets, as well as a cross-shaped cut-out for air ventilation. ";

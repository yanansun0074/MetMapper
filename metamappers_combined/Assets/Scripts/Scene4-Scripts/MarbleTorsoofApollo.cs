As was the custom during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, contemporary sculptors carved the missing parts and added them to what remained of the ancient statue. This torso was mistakenly restored as Dionysos instead of Apollo. The seventeenth-century additions were removed when it came to The Metropolitan Museum of Art.";

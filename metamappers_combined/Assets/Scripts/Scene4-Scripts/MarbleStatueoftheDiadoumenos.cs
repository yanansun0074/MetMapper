Its beauty and fame are mentioned three times in ancient literature, and over twenty-five full-size marble copies are known. This copy was owned by the Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani of Rome, who, during the first third of the seventeenth century, formed one of the earliest European collections of ancient art. Scholars had not yet identified this statue type as the Polykleitan Diadoumenos, and an incorrect head and arms were added to complete the figure. These have since been removed.";

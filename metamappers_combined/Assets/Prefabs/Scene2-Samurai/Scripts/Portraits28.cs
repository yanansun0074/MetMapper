        description = "In this print, Kitao Shigemasa (1739–1820), an artist of the ukiyo-e genre (known for woodblock prints and paintings), portrays twenty-eight of the most influential sword-fitting makers of the Edo period (1615–1868). Sitting at the top of this imaginary gathering is Yokoya Somin (1670–1733), who is celebrated for his role as initiator of a movement that ushered in a renaissance of the craft. The way Somin is highlighted in terms of position, size, and frontal view, with the other artists arranged in a circle, can be interpreted as an allusion to spiritual mandalas that feature buddhas and bodhisattvas.";

        description = "The style of this mounting, known as toppei-koshirae, emerged at the end of the Edo period (1615–1868). It reflects the influence of Western infantry swords at a time when Japan was modernizing its armed forces. The fittings, including a hilt collar dated 1871, are masterworks by Takamoto Hidemune (1819–1887), who had trained with one of the last great masters of the Edo period, Tanaka Kiyotoshi (1804–1876). The scabbard is decorated with a delicate makie lacquer décor in the form of Chinese silver grass. The blade is unsigned, but exhibits the style of the Late Seki (Sue-Seki) smiths of the 16th century.";

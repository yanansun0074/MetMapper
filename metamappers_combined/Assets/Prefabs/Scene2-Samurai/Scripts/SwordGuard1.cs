        description = "This is the larger guard of a matching pair of sword guards (daishō-tsuba) made by Ishiguro Masatsune (1760–1828) (pair with 43.120.724). It features a hawk perched on a rock above the sea. The depiction of birds and flowers was the forte of the Ishiguro School, which was established by Masatsune toward the end of the eighteenth century. The solemn character of their interpretations, seen here in the magnificent birds of prey, made Ishiguro works popular among Samurai and elevated the school to one of the most thriving centers of sword-fitting production in Edo (present-day Tokyo).";

        description = "One of Ishiguro Masayoshi’s (1774–1862) masterpieces, this is a rare complete set of fittings for a pair of swords (daishō), comprising sword guards (tsuba), knife handles (kozuka), hilt ornaments (menuki), pommels (kashira), and hilt collars (fuchi).The decoration features rabbits and the horsetail plant, a traditional combination. In Asian folklore, the dark markings on the near side of the moon are interpreted as a rabbit that makes the moon shine brightly by polishing it with horsetail. Masayoshi was one of the most renowned artists of the Ishiguro School, and his luxurious interpretations contributed greatly to the school’s success.";

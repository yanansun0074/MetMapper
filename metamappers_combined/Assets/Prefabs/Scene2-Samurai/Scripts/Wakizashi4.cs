        description = "This is the short sword (wakizashi) of a pair of swords (daishō) once in the collection of the Tokugawa shogun's family. It features a scabbard with polished and lacquered, exquisitely fine-textured ray skin, and hilts that are wrapped with delicately braided cords. The gold hilt ornaments (menuki) and knife handle (kozuka), mounted to the reverse of the scabbard, are works by the fifth-generation Gotō artist, Tokujō (1550–1631). Tokujō's descendant, the fifteenth Gotō generation Mitsuyoshi (1788–1834), made the sword guard. Its terraced concave shape is rare, and displays the finest form of nanako, a surface finish with small dots.";

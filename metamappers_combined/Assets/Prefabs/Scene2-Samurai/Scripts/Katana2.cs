        description = "This is the long sword (katana) of a pair of swords (daishō) which is mounted with a matching set of fittings depicting insects and plants that are traditionally associated with fall in Japan. The fittings were made by Otsuryūken Masanobu (born 1773), who was the fourth generation of the Hamano School. Some are inscribed with statements such as “made at the age of sixty-two” or “made at the age of sixty-three,” an inidication of the lengthy time it took him to produce the full set. The lower parts of the scabbard are lacquered in broad brush strokes, a technique referred to as seikaiha-nuri (literally “blue waves lacquer”).";

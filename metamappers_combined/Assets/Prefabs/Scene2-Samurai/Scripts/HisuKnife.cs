On the obverse, the surface is finished with small dots referred to as nanako, leaving a gilded bank of clouds and the snow-covered peak of Mount Fuji in relief. This kozuka and two more sword fittings in The Met’s collection are featured in the artist’s sketchbook titled Album of Designs for Metal Carving.";

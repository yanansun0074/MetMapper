        description = "This mounting is distinguished by its fittings made of multiple alternating layers of copper-gold alloy (shakudō) and dark red copper (hiirodō), which are carved in a spiral manner to reveal the layers. This technique, referred to as guribori, has its roots in lacquerwork. Swords mounted with a matching set of guribori fittings are rare. Covering the scabbard is a type of ray skin whose nodules resemble plum blossoms (Japanese: kairagi). It has been lacquered black and then polished to reveal parts of its texture. The blade is unsigned, but can be attributed to an Owari-Seki swordsmith from the early Edo period (17th century).";

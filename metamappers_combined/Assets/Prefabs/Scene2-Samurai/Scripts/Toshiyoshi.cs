Several sheets bear dates between 1865 and 1884. Toshiyoshi, who went by the artist names Kōsō and Ryūganshi, was one of the best students of Tanaka Kiyotoshi (1804–1876), a self-taught Edo-based artist who went on to establish one of the largest and most important schools of sword-fitting making in Japanese history.";

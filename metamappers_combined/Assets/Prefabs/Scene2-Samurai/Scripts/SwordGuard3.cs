        description = "This is the larger guard (tsuba) of a pair of sword guards that is the product of a collaboration among three artists. Ishiguro Masaaki (born 1813) crafted it after a smaller guard (19.71.6) of the same design to create a matching set for the traditional pair of swords worn by a samurai . It features an extraordinary openwork design of a flower basket whose quatrefoil rim is decorated with a Greek-style key pattern inlaid in gold. The smaller guardm for the wakizashi, was made by father and son Hagiya Katsuhira (1804–1886) and Suzuki Katsuhiro (1827–1886) in 1860.";

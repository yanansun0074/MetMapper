Based in his hometown of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province and center of the so-called Zhe school of commercial painting, Lan Meng specialized in monumental landscapes executed in mineral pigments on silk, but he also created intimate works on paper in the styles of fourteenth-century scholar-artists.";

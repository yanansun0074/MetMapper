The youngest of these, Wang Yuanqi, exerted a great influence on younger painters, including his grandson Wang Chen, whose fan you see here. Wang worked in a loose, wet version of his grandfather’s manner; he achieved enough fame in his own right to be counted among a group known as the “Lesser Four Wangs” who carried the original Four Wangs' legacy forward into the nineteenth century.";
